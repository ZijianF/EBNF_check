ReadMe for project 2 by Zijian Feng
The program can be compiled and ran using general ways of running rust program.

It is also able to distinguish variable and function identifiers in the parser part.

Flaws:
1. It is unable to format the output file with space and new lines characters.

2. The program does not terminate if there are syntactical error.

There still are some potential bugs, but the program is able to scan through the files and properly tokenize it.
